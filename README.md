## What is event sourcing

Event sourcing is a development pattern to solve audit problems and make our application more easily maintainable. It is described as:

> **A way to capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.**

There's not much jabber about it right now, however this pattern first emerged in one of Martin Fowler's [articles](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) in 2005, for some reason it's been forgotten ever since.

I'm not describing it all here, however I have a series of related material (in portuguese) so you can study it for yourself.
